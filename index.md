  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a <strong>multilingual IT specialist</strong> with <strong>8&nbsp;years of experience</strong> in full-stack development, quality assurance, and product ownership.
    I’m currently completing a <em>BSc in Artificial Intelligence&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Robotics</em>, focusing on machine learning and data science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve streamlined workflows and led cross-functional teams on three continents.
    As I deepen my AI expertise, I’m eager to apply hands-on engineering skills to drive practical innovation for clients.

    This blog began as a space for my project proposal in the <em>Deep Generative Models</em> class of the HFU Master’s program.
